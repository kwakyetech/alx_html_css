# 🎧 Headphones Website - ALX Project

Welcome to the **Headphones** web page project! This responsive and accessible webpage was implemented from scratch using pure HTML and CSS, based on a Figma design by Nicolas Philippot. It is part of the **ALX Front-End Development Curriculum**, under the module **Implement a Design from Scratch**.

- Semantic HTML5 structure
- CSS styling and layout
- Accessibility best practices
- Responsive design (for mobile ≤ 480px)
- Pixel-perfect implementation using Figma
