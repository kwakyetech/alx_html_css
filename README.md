# 🎨 CSS Fundamentals Project

Welcome to your **CSS Fundamentals Project!**  
This project will help you take your first steps into the world of **web styling** — using only **HTML** and **CSS**. By the end, you’ll know how to make plain web pages look clean, structured, and visually engaging.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you’ll be able to explain to anyone:

- ✅ **What is CSS** and why we use it to style web pages.
- ✅ How to **add style to an HTML element** directly or with external style sheets.
- ✅ What a **class** is and how to use it to style multiple elements consistently.
- ✅ What a **selector** is and how different types work.
- ✅ How to **compute CSS Specificity Value** to resolve style conflicts.
- ✅ What **Box properties** are in CSS (margin, padding, border, content) and how they affect layout.
- ✅ How the **browser loads and applies CSS** when rendering a webpage.

## 🧩 Project Requirements

To keep your project organized and standards-compliant:

- Make sure **all your files end with a new line**.
- Include a `README.md` file (this one!) at the **root of your project folder**.
- **Do NOT** use any external libraries or frameworks — no Bootstrap, no NodeJS, no React, no VueJS.
- Use only **HTML**, **CSS**, and (if needed) **vanilla JavaScript**.
- Make sure your HTML and CSS code is **W3C compliant** — validate your work with the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).

## 🚀 What You’ll Practice

During this project, you’ll gain hands-on experience with:

- **Linking CSS:** Use `<style>` tags and external `.css` files.
- **Selectors:** Target elements with tag selectors, class selectors, and ID selectors.
- **Classes:** Reuse styles across multiple elements to keep your code clean.
- **Specificity:** Understand how the browser decides which style rule to apply when multiple rules match.
- **The Box Model:** Control spacing, borders, and layout with margin, padding, and border properties.
- **Best Practices:** Write clean, readable CSS that’s easy to maintain.
